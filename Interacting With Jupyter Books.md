# Working with Jupyter Books

This and other chapters of *Basic Concepts of Fixed Income*, contain two types of documents:

1. **Markdown documents (*.md*):**  
   * What you are currently reading.
   * Contain no executable code.  
   * Can be downloaded as a Markdown file (*.md*) or a PDF file (*.pdf*).  
2. **Notebook documents (*.ipynb*):**  
   * HTML Representations of Jupyter notebooks.
   * Can be downloaded as a notebook (*.ipynb*) or a PDF file (*.pdf*). 
   * Have interactive capabilities.  
   * In a notebook like *Calculating and Graphing the Term Structure of Interest Rates*, icons are available in the upper-right corner for launching and downloading the notebook.

Notebook Launch Options

The launch icon provides three interactive options for notebook documents:

| Option | Description | Interactive Features | Note |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Binder** | Launches in a new browser tab (typically within a minute) and runs remotely. Supports up to 100 simultaneous users. | Execute existing cells, add or modify cells, and download the notebook. | The notebook will not be saved or available if saved in this mode. |
| **Colab** | Offers the quickest and easiest access, not requiring Binder. A Google Drive is unnecessary for launching. | Execute cells or make a copy. | You must sign in to a Google account to execute cells or make a copy. You can download the notebook without signing into a Google account. |
| **Live Code** | Requires a Binder launch and is ideal for demonstrations. | Run code in existing cells, and alter code in existing cells. | You cannot add cells or save results in this mode. |

Additional Interactive Feature

**Copying code:** Any code cell or code block can be copied to the clipboard by moving the cursor to its upper-right corner.

Summary

Jupyter books effectively combine Markdown and notebooks to highlight financial concepts with real-world applications.

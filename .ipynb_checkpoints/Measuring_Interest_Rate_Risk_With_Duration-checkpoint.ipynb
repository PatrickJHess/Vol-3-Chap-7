    "The interest rate risk for a bondholder is fundamentally summarized by the relationship between a bond's duration and its yield to maturity (YTM). To demonstrate how YTM influences the duration of a bond with a constant coupon, calculations are performed for both a ten-year and a thirty-year bond, each carrying a five percent coupon rate. The bonds' YTM is calculated from the monthly ten and thirty par yields.\n"

    "This graph demonstrates that fixing the coupon highlights the negative relation between duration and yield to maturity. For a thirty-year bond, the duration exhibits notable changes with varying yields to maturity: slightly less than 16 at 5%, slightly less than 17 at 4%, and slightly more than 14.75 at 6%. The differences are less pronounced for the ten-year bond, with the duration being slightly less than eight at 5%, slightly more at 4%, and slightly less again at 6%.\n",

    "Understanding duration dynamics is crucial for investors. Because duration decreases as the yield to maturity increases, investors typically experience better outcomes than what is suggested by the duration calculation. Specifically, decreasing rates lead to higher gains, and increasing rates result in smaller losses. This advantageous phenomenon is known as convexity-the focus of the next chapter.\n"
